# BCI2000-Apps
Applications created using BCI2000

[BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) is a general purpose brain-computer interface (BCI) system created by [Schalk et. al](http://www.bci2000.org/downloads/doc/paper.pdf). This repository contains a few applications I created as part of running BCI experiments while collecting electroencephalography (EEG) data from participants.
